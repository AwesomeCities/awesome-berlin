# Awesome Berlin

> A curated list of Berlin's awesomeness

## Coffee

- [Bonanza Coffee Heroes](https://goo.gl/maps/8ypyJyodVsF2) - Take their profession very seriously. Nice interior design. Awesome Coffee.
- [BUSCAGLIONE](https://goo.gl/maps/trQ8umaJT2Q2) - Like going to Mama. Awesome Coffee. Warm vibes. Tasty snacks.
- [Café Suicide Sue](https://goo.gl/maps/Pbez2TovzNT2) - Very nice interiour design. Food and coffee are very well made. You can work there too.
- [Kaffeerösterei Pakolat](https://goo.gl/maps/jEMsjj1QuAy) - One of my favorite places easily. They have a cake manufacture and make very very good coffee. I spent my birthday there in a small round. It was awesome.

## Lunch

- [BUN BAO • Finest Asian Burgers](https://goo.gl/maps/7FmxRXPBrwC2)
- [Chen Che](https://goo.gl/maps/u3B6eFPNGLq) - Awesome interiour design. A lot of flavour. It's a 100% recommendation to go there.
- [Chimaeg Korean BBQ](https://goo.gl/maps/4ZQj6Ere39v) - This place is new and not in yelp or anything yet. It's below the U-Bahn Schönhauser Allee across McDonalds. Had a long talk with some korean guests. They've promised me that this is the best korean chicken in Berlin. Chimaeg isn't the real name. I will change that. But chimaeg stands for chi(cken) and maeg(ju). Maegju is korean for beer. So it's chicken and beer! Perfect! You can have half and half if you can't decide on the sauce.
- [Dudu](https://goo.gl/maps/CRqvDrGoBJM2) - I bit hidden but very popular. Very good lunch and Sushi. Nice interiour design.
- [häppies](https://goo.gl/maps/VhXz4Ent3q32) - Germknödel or "yeast dumpling filled with plum sauce" is the translation for this Austrian dish. German's love it and happies revolutionized it with non traditional fillings. Pesto and cheese. Mexican style. You Name it. The owner didn't want to work as much in the ad industry anymore. This place is crowed-funded. Every häppie illustration represents one of the crowed funders.
- [Joris Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/GihtTwQWwHS2) - Baked potatoes with non-traditional fillings. Very tasty. Very filling.
- [La Pausa Torstraße](https://goo.gl/maps/W76My2AomSs)
- [Rosenburger](https://goo.gl/maps/VSQjFHuYhuj)
- [Tommis Burger Joint](https://goo.gl/maps/V3cmi6yHTkv) - I made it there a few times. You get a very good burger without fancy stuff. The basics are done right. But you can tell that they care.
- [Umami Prenzlauer Berg](https://goo.gl/maps/tFQ4vGhVAeP2) - Homemade Indochinese kitchen. My favorite Indochinese place so far. Levels up everything you had before 10x.
- [Yellow Burgermanufaktur](https://goo.gl/maps/6TLgnnYfEL52) - Very well homemade burger. I believe they serve it with self made mayonese which makes it softer then the bought ones. They have a burger of the month that is crazy good each time.

## Beverages

- [Getränkefeinkost Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/iuh2MQSZZYQ2) - If you need a variarity of awesome beers and sodas this is the place to go. I go there regulary. There is always something new to choose from. The owner curates the beverages, so that there is no plastic, no cans. Glass only. And no evil mega corps.
- [Meta Mate Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/7duaRBjNGyD2) - If you know Berlin, you know we drink a lot of mate. If you like mate you have to go there. You'll find a wide range of mate products. For fresh made mate the trick is to use slowly dried mate. If you get mate from a regular supermarked then it will be dried quicky and the flavors and soul are gone. You'll find dried mate, mate sodas, mate chocolate, mate beer, mate schnaps! The owners are very lovely people.

## Restaurants

- [Omoni](https://goo.gl/maps/LGtL7fio6x12) - One of the best sushi places in Prenzlauer Berg. Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Super tasty sushi. They don't have fancy stuff. They just do it right.
- [Sasaya](https://goo.gl/maps/VfnfnDZrruz) - Also in Prenzlauer Berg. I remember it to be super good. They open for lunch and for dinner. It's closed in between. You should make a reservation.
- [Standard Serious Pizza](https://goo.gl/maps/ZSd5GzitNgK2) - Neapolitan pizza at its best. A bit pricy but it's worth giving it a try. The dough is very soft and the ingredients are 1st class.
- [Lecker Song Dim Sum Spezialitäten aus Peking](https://goo.gl/maps/XasKmRPKDaQ2) - A very small place that serves home made chinese dumplings. There are a few vegan and a few options with meat.
